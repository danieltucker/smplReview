# smplReview
Simple customer review form that allows you to move customers with complaints to your internal reply system and happy customers to a review of your choice.

<b>Configurable rating system</b><br>
smplReview allows you to use simple Good & Bad ratings or allows for a more fine tuned star based approach.  

<b>Set your own review floor & list as many review sites as you want</b><br>
You can set a floor for reviews so you can help insure only highly happy customers are sent to your review sites.  By default I suggest setting it to 4 so users that rate you 3 or less are automatically sent to your email so you can rectify the situation without being dinged online. 

When a user selects a poor review before seeing your smplReview page, for instance in an email you can enable automatic hiding of the review options all together to help remove the possibility of them clicking a positive review in order to get to a review site.

Review sites will soon have the ability to be weighted so the most important ones get the highest priority.

## ToDo
